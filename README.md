# NeuralNetwork
This is a simple implementation of a fully connected neural network.
This was mainly put together in order to gain a deeper understanding of the math behind backpropogation and the structure of neural networks.

In order to use this in tandem with the mnist dataset, I recommend using the repository located [here](https://github.com/jdvallad/mnist).

Enjoy!
